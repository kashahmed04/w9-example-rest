    <!-- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog -->
    <!--so everything in dialog tags within it will show up in the popup which is what dialog is made for**
      the .showmodal() shows the popup box when we say it in the JS when we target the dialoge tag (only used in the JS)**
      the .close() closes the popup when we are done and we have to target the dialoge tag and do .close() to close the popup (only in the JS)**
      by default we cant click outside of the popup and its still active unless we press escape or put an entry right but when we press outside it does not
      close the popup by default (so we can only open one popup at a time for example)**
      when we do the dialog tag targetting in the JS .show() is that when we can click outside of popup and interact
      with things outside of the popup (maybe allowing us to open multple popups at a time for example)** and exit the popup as well when we click outside of it**
    
    HTML:
    * 
    * <dialoge> gives us some sort of box (like a popup box that floats and we can put things in that box)
    * and it has a .showmodal() and close() method and by default we cant click anything else when
    * we are in the popup box and press escape to exit the box (for free with <dialoge>)** (this is all there is to dialog right only the .showmodal(),
      .close(), and .show() right)**-->
